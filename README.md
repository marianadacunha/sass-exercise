# General Info

This is a project based on the following tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roywYSEPSvc">Learn Sass in this Crash Course - Give your CSS Superpowers!<a>.

Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance and much more. It's translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a plugin for your build system.
